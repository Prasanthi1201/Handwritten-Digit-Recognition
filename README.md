# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Project Description

This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The model architecture consists of a pre-trained CNN (ResNeXt) for feature extraction followed by an LSTM layer for sequence modeling. Additionally, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features are extracted from the input images to enhance recognition accuracy.

## Basic Run Instructions

### Environment Setup

- Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

- Clone the repository or download the files provided.
- Install the required Python packages by running:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Data

- The dataset is provided in the repository. Ensure that the dataset is located in the same directory as the notebook or modify the notebook to load the dataset from the correct location.

### Running the Code

- Open the `CV_project_digit.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or any other compatible environment.
- Run the notebook cells one by one to train and evaluate the model.
- The notebook contains detailed explanations and comments to guide you through each step of the process.

### Using Command Line

- Alternatively, you can run the provided Python script `cv_project_digit.py` from the command line.
- Navigate to the directory containing the script.
- Run the script using the following command:
- `python B20CS010_B20AI007_B20AI045.py`
